#### My future goal is to become a professional in my profession and thereby improve my family's lifestyle. Family is everything, no matter where I am, family supports me when I need it, and I also support the family when it needs me.
#### My hobbies are reading book and playing chess with my brother. Reading a book is the most effective way to become disciplined and stop thinking. My favorite book is the psychology of influence, written by Robert Chaldini. Playing chess is just a pastime and I communicate with my brother.
#### Until now, I have been very interested in the field of programming, but there was no opportunity. But now I am ready to start a career in programming. I have a lot of programming language html, of course it's not enough but it's the first step to start reading.
#### I am currently studying management at Tashkent State Technical University and I am a 1st year student.
#### I started studying English last June and within 1 year I got 5.5 score in IELTS.
